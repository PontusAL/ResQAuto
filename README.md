# ResQAuto
This is supposed to be an automated script that develops into a application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerised deployment)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Quick Start

### macOS

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ResQAuto.git
   cd ResQAuto
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure the application by setting the `QA_NAME` environment variable.
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python3 resqauto.py
   ```

### Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t resqauto .
   ```
2. Run the container with the `QA_NAME` environment variable set:
   ```
   docker run -e QA_NAME=your_name resqauto
   ```

## Configuration

- `QA_NAME`: Set this environment variable to specify the operator's name or identifier. This is required for personalised logs and reports.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible with your Python version.
- Verify that the `QA_NAME` environment variable is correctly set.
- Check Docker permissions if running inside a container.
- Consult the logs generated by the application for detailed error messages.
